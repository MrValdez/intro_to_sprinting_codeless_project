One early morning
In the middle of the night.
Two dead boys,
Got up to fight.

Back to back,
they faced each other.
They drew their swords,
and shot each other.

A deaf policeman heard the noise.
Came and killed, the two dead boys.

Now, if you do not believe this lie is true...
Ask the blind man, he saw it, too!
